## Predictions for the future of the area & suggestions on how jobs in the area should evolve:.
1. As AI become more powerful and perform better, a game development team will start to shrink as less and less people are required to develop a game.<sup>[[5]](#ref5)</sup>
2. When a fully customisable and open-source game appears, people would be able to get paid by getting commission for building add-ons and plug-ins for the game. As creating add-ons or plug-ins is simpler than creating a new game, this would be a more popular options for new game developers.
3. Indie game platforms would be getting more visits as more and more game developers go indie. This would decrease AAA game development company competitiveness in the market, causing massive layoffs of game developers.<sup>[[6]](#ref6)</sup>
4. Indie game development would be popular because with a smaller budget, usually around 0.1 to 1 million USD<sup>[[7]](#ref7)</sup>, it is much easier for the developers to gain profit compared to AAA game development companies, whose budget could be around 35 to 45 million USD.<sup>[[8]](#ref8)</sup>
