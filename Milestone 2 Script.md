# Area: Game Design and Development

## Milestone 2 Script
**User:** 
I am currently on a semester break. I wish to find a game to play during this time. Who knows? Maybe I might even find ideas for my school project!

**Sales Representative A:**
Hi there, would you like to try our newest game? It’s called *Baldi’s Basics*. It is a game where you play hide n’ seek with your teacher while solving math questions scattered around the map. We have both free and paid versions.

- For the free version, there will be some premium game modes locked behind a paid gate.
- For the paid version, everything is unlocked once you have paid for the game. 

Working with passion, updates for the game are highly unscheduled and might stop updating for a long time.<sup>[[1]](#ref1)</sup>

**Sales Representative B:**
No, no, no. You should try out our game! It is called *Honkai: Star Rail* where you play as a trailblazer wandering across each planet solving their problem. We are a gacha game where each update will have a limited character for the players to draw. This is how we continue supporting this game even though we are a free-to-play game.<sup>[[2]](#ref2)</sup>

**User:**
Hmmm, both games sound interesting. It is good to hear that the game development community has evolved so much. I am wondering if is there currently any support from the government for any of us who are interested in joining a career in game development.

**Policy Maker:**
Yes, our current Minister of Digital of Malaysia has allowed global video game commerce company *Xsolla Inc*. to collaborate with Curine Ventures to launch the *Xsolla Curine Academy (XCA)* in *KL Eco City* as:

- A catalyst for propelling the gaming industry.
- To empower at least 1,000 game industry specialists from designers, artists, programmers and producers.
- To achieve a world-class standard in game development.
- To ensure the growth and sustainability of the digital economy in Malaysia.<sup>[[3]](#ref3)</sup> 

*XCA* provide various game development courses, as long as 12 months course and as short as a month course being done via online, physically or hybrid. Providing Malaysians a pathway into game development, to work in a game development company or as a part-time indie game developer.<sup>[[4]](#ref4)</sup> *MDEC* is very passionate about nurturing talent, fostering creativity and enabling growth in the digital economy.<sup>[[5]](#ref5)</sup> 

> We want to offer a dynamic platform where budding game developers, designers and entrepreneurs can converge, innovate and flourish. This initiative is not solely about skill-building, as it also catalyzes aspirations and propels the gaming industry into a new era of excellence.<sup>[[3]](#ref3)</sup>

**Sales Representative A:**
Schools like *XCA* are great since they can teach new indie game developers to: 

- Start making games.
- Build prototypes.
- Build your portfolio.
- Expand their networking with other upcoming game developers, potentially having a collab with them for future big projects.

Having a teacher guiding students in game development such as how to use *Unity* would be great as it lowers the difficulty for students and upcoming game developers to build their first project.<sup>[[6]](#ref6)</sup>

**Policy Maker:**
In addition to that, the government would like to attract more international collaborations and investments to create games that are not only commercially successful but also culturally significant.<sup>[[3]](#ref3)</sup> The Minister of Digital of Malaysia, *Mr. Gobind Singh Deo* has said that:<sup>[[7]](#ref7)</sup> 

> MDEC would also help in building the Malaysian brand through industry support and leadership via regional research and thought leadership papers, regional conferences, as well as business events such as Level Up KL, Kre8tif!, Immerse KL, and broad-based consumer events such as the Malaysia Digital Content Festival (MYDCF). 

> MDEC will also be facilitating investments and market access support through participation in the Annecy Festival, Games Developer Conference, and the Tokyo Game Show to support IP growth, incubate new studios and targeted skills development programmes such as the Digital Content Incubation Programme, delivery of the Digital Content Grant and the Digital Content Creators Challenge.

*Kaveh Wong*, the co-founder of the *XCA* has also said:<sup>[[3]](#ref3)</sup>

> Collaboration is the key to success in Malaysia’s game industry and she is proud to partner with MDEC (Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation), Epic Games, Unity and other industry players to create a vibrant and thriving ecosystem for the game development in the country.

**User:**
It’s very relieving to see that the government is planning to broaden the nation’s economy in more sectors. But, what are currently the requirements or important items to consider to gain employment in the gaming industry?

**Sales Representative B:**
Our company requires at least:<sup>[[8]](#ref8)</sup>

- A diploma certificate in computer science
- More than 3 years of experience in the game industry
- More than 1 year of experience in Unity and C#
- Good communication and collaboration skills
- Self-driven learning ability
- Analytical problem-solving ability
- A strong sense of responsibility

**Sales Representative A:** 
In game development, mathematics is the most important, more specifically:

- Trigonometry
- Linear algebra
- Statistic
- calculus

Everything else can be learned relatively easily, it seems most programmers who try to venture into game development fail specifically because of a lack of appropriate math background because video games are more math-heavy than most other types of applications.<sup>[[9]](#ref9)</sup>

**User:** 
I have some questions for the sales representatives. What are the pros and cons of joining an indie game development team compared to a company game development team?

**Sales Representative A:**
To answer your question, indie studio has smaller teams and projects often have smaller budgets and shorter timelines. This can encourage creativity and innovation but also means limited resources. However, developers have greater creative freedom, as they often have more control over the vision and direction of the game. Indie game companies may offer more flexible hours but can also demand long hours, especially near deadlines due to limited staff. Job security can be more precarious due to reliance on funding and sales. However, there may be opportunities for rapid skill development and career progression within the studio.<sup>[[10]](#ref10)</sup>

**Sales Representative B:**
Our company has larger teams with more defined roles and hierarchies. There are specialized departments, such as:

- Art
- Design
- Programming

Leading to a more structured workflow. Projects usually have large budgets and longer development cycles, allowing for high production values but also leading to more pressure to meet expectations and deadlines. More constraints due to: 

- Market research
- Brand expectations
- Shareholder interests

Often associated with "crunch" periods leading up to a game's release, which can impact work-life balance negatively. Generally, more stable employment with benefits, but layoffs can still occur, especially after project completions. Opportunities for advancement may be more structured.<sup>[[10]](#ref10)</sup>

**User:**
I heard that *Honkai: Star Rail* is a gacha game. What is the government’s opinion on predatory or damaging game systems such as the gacha system in games?

**Policy Maker:**
As a representative of the Malaysian government, the *Malaysian Federal Territories Mufti’s Office* would like to state that

> The gacha system in video games which is the act of purchasing and opening in-game loot boxes using real money is considered a sin and is akin to gambling. 

Many games implement a gacha system in which players “place a bet” using premium currency that can be purchased using real money to obtain limited characters that are only obtainable by “placing a bet”. Only the lucky players will be able to obtain these limited characters while unlucky players will be unable to do so and have to purchase in-game currency to afford to “place a bet” once again. The Mufti’s office advises Muslim players to refrain from spending money on games with gacha systems.<sup>[[11]](#ref11)</sup>

**Players:**
We players also hate the inclusion of gacha systems in games as:

1. They have the potential to start addictions within their players.
2. As the dopamine from indulging in using the gacha system reinforces the user to spend more time on the game and indulge in spending more money in the game to chase a similar release and feeling of pleasure.
3. This is further reinforced by how many games will create limited-time events to obtain special rewards, daily login events and limited-time banners to boost pick-up rates of certain characters to create the fear of missing out and create a sense of urgency in the player base to entice them to spend more time and money in the game.

Some players may refuse to stop playing these games since they have invested too much time and money to abandon the game. Because of the unwillingness to stop, it only helps to further entice them to continue playing the game, which self-reinforces their dopamine releases related to the game, and by extension, their addiction to it.<sup>[[12]](#ref12)</sup>

**Sales Representative B:** 
We understand the concerns that the government and players might have. We assure you that gacha systems in games have always been legal and are not predatory. 

> All players carry the responsibility of managing their own time and money. They also have the freedom on where they decide to spend their money.

The gacha system in games is a good monetisation strategy proven in many territories for getting the most out of high-paying users. For example, *Honkai: Star Rail* which is a game that implements a gacha system has made 310,188,814$ from the system.<sup>[[20]](#ref20)</sup> If there are more mechanical and progression-based benefits attached to a gacha system like how you might need a certain character for top-level playing, we would be able to monetise higher on a per-player basis. However, this would only benefit studios in the short run since they can become a problem and alienate the player base especially if it’s a highly competitive game. 

> A good gacha system implementation should be in the pre-launch of the game to maximize the revenue from in-app purchases, therefore maximizing the retention of your players from day one.<sup>[[14]](#ref14)</sup>

**User:**
I’ve recently read a study, that showed that 

> 69.1% of participants in this study indicated that they play online games with their friends from schools, clubs, and social gathering. This study has examined the prevalence of online gaming addiction among early Malaysian adolescents between the ages of 10 to 14 years old. This study found 1.9% of the participating adolescents are addicted to online gaming.<sup>[[15]](#ref15)</sup>

> Video game addiction could cause changes in behaviour and mood, such as social isolation, ignoring previously enjoyed activities and withdrawal when not playing, they might even feel irritability, anxiety or depression.

> They will also notice a declining performance in school or work due to a loss of control over time spent in gaming. Besides that, consequences of video game addiction can showcase in several ways, including wrist, neck and elbow pain, skin blisters, calluses and sleep.<sup>[[16]](#ref16)</sup>

Why are people addicted to video games? And is there any way to reduce the amount of people getting addicted to video games?

**Policy Maker:**
There are three primary motives such as a sense of achievement, social interaction with other gamers and immersion, which is possible when youths play games to counter academic failure and dysfunctional relationships with significant others or to escape real-life problems. It is important to understand the motives for playing video games. Traditional restrictive methods such as not allowing one to play games for some time might not work in many situations. For example,

> If a youth is having issues with friends, he might want to play video games to fulfil his social needs, and this is why it is important to understand the motives for playing them. Instead, such youths should identify alternatives such as joining a community service programme or enrolling in self-improvement classes to enhance their social skills or build their social circles.<sup>[[17]](#ref17)</sup>

**Sales Representative A:**
By implementing responsible game design practices, developers can create games that are both engaging and fun while minimizing the risk of addiction. For instance,

>  Developers can add timers that remind players to take breaks, limit daily playtime, and reward players for taking breaks. 

These features can help prevent excessive gaming and minimize the risk of addiction. It is also important to design games that are enjoyable but not overly rewarding. Games that rely heavily on random rewards, such as loot boxes, can be especially addictive. By designing games that are rewarding but not excessively so, developers can create a fun and engaging experience without the risk of addiction.<sup>[[18]](#ref18)</sup>

**Sales Representative B:**
Game testing serves not only to detect technical issues but also to recognize triggers that lead to addiction to video games. Trained game testers diligently scan games for elements that could be addictive, such as: 

- Achievements
- Rewards
- Gameplay mechanics that may encourage players to continue playing. 

Game developers can then take steps to address any addiction triggers that are identified. For instance, they may: 
- Modify or remove certain gameplay mechanics that can cause addiction
- Adjust the game's difficulty level to attain equilibrium. 
- Include features that promote healthy gameplay habits, like reminders to take breaks
- Options to restrict gameplay time. 

Game developers can collaborate with mental health professionals to create games designed to prevent addiction. They can incorporate mindfulness exercises or relaxation techniques into the gameplay experience, helping players cope with stress and anxiety.<sup>[[18]](#ref18)</sup>

**User:** 
With the massive increase of players, are there any policies that exist to protect players from data privacy breaches? 
> Data privacy is crucial, as 85% of global adults want more control over their online privacy. It protects individuals from fraud, identity theft, and other malicious activities resulting from unauthorized access to personal information. 

With the innovation of technology, where cyber-attacks are becoming more common, protecting personal data helps prevent significant data breaches and financial losses. By ensuring the responsible handling of personal information, you can minimize the risk of such threats and promote a safer digital environment. Additionally, data privacy is essential for building and maintaining trust between consumers and organizations. When people feel confident that their data is being protected and used appropriately, they are more likely to engage with and trust businesses.<sup>[[19]](#ref19)</sup>

**Policy Maker:**
There are policies in place that protect players' data. One of them is called the *Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)* and it came into force in November 2013 and is heavily based on the *European Data Protection Directive*. Under the Malaysian *PDPA*,<sup>[[20]](#ref20)</sup>

> Data users are required to obtain the consent of data subjects for the processing, which includes the collection and disclosure, of their data. Where consent is required from a data subject under the age of eighteen, the data user should obtain consent from the parent or guardian.

Game companies will need to<sup>[[21]](#ref21)</sup>

> Ask for the subject’s consent if the data is to be disclosed for any other purpose other than the purpose for which the personal data was to be disclosed at the time of collection. They also need to take practical steps to protect the personal data from any loss, misuse, unauthorized or accidental access or disclosures. They are also required to permanently delete any personal data that is no longer required for the purpose it was to be processed.

**Sales Representative A:**
Because we produce offline games, there is no data server to protect. However, the game should have a restricted set of capabilities, so it can’t access random files on your customers’ hard drives. This is to prevent someone from being able to package malicious code into a mod and upload it online. When somebody runs our game, we must ensure that our game is not some kind of malware to steal their data, hold it hostage, damage their computer, etc. It’s not just our code that they have to trust, but also all the third-party libraries we have used to make our game.<sup>[[22]](#ref22)</sup>

**Sales Representative B:**
Since we produce online games, we implement strong authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) that can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. MFA requires users to: 

- Provide two or more verification factors.
- Adding an extra layer of security beyond the standard username and password. 
- Encouraging players to use complex passwords
- Regularly update them can enhance account security. 

Our server hosts employ tools that track login attempts, account changes, and in-game transactions for anomalies. Setting up alerts for unusual activities can help identify potential security breaches before they escalate. Additionally, we provide players with tools to report suspicious behaviour and ensure such reports are handled swiftly to help maintain a secure gaming environment. Because of that, having a well-defined response plan is crucial for handling security incidents efficiently. Our server hosts establish protocols for: 

- Isolating affected accounts
- Investigating the breach
- Communicating with affected players. 

We provide clear instructions for password resets and we secure compromised accounts to help mitigate the impact of a breach. Moreover, we conduct a thorough post-incident analysis to identify and address the root cause of the breach to bolster future security efforts.<sup>[[23]](#ref23)</sup>
